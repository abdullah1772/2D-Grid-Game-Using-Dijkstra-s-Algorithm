# 2D-Grid-Game-Using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm

The game is a single 2D N*M grid where N and M can varry. The Grid is populated with random numbers from 0 to 9. The Agent starts in the top left corner of the grid.
The Goal of the agent is to reach the bottom right corner of the grid, taking the shortest path possible.
The agent use a naive approach, that doesn't use any hurestics, just moves towards left right or diagonal block, based on shortest distance, and Dijkstr's algorithm to iterate over the grid and find the shortest path possible.
